		h1 Mods to Avoid
		p #[strong ENBoost:] Hacky memory sharing between processes that is not needed. ENBoost also needs a lot of system-specific configuration to work properly and can degrade performance without proper tweaking.
		p #[strong Fores New Idles:] Unsupported and dated, lots of new animation mods will not work with this. Use #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60033", target="_blank") Nemesis] instead.
		p #[strong Achievements Mods Enabler:] Achievements are already enabled by #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230", target="_blank") Engine Fixes].
		p #[strong HDT-SMP:] Completely replaced and superseded #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339", target="_blank") Faster HDT-SMP].
		p #[strong Breezehome (by Elianora):] Has lots of errors and deleted navmeshes that will cause crashing, do not use without #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48931", target="_blank") this patch].
		p #[strong Oversized textures:] Based on the object size and how the texture is wrapped around it, you should pick textures with a reasonable resolution and avoid the very big ones also based on your display resolution. Keep in mind that the textures will not be displayed with their full resolution at all times, in fact they will be scaled down because of #[a(href="https://imgsli.com/MTMwNjU2", target="_blank") mipmaps] based on distance and other factors, as shown with these sliders. Just for reference, a maximum of 2K at 1080p is a pretty safe bet in terms of balance.
		p #[strong Parallax:] Any mod applying parallax on meshes will have to replace them, often reverting important fixes. Not easy to manage for beginners and they are not worth the visual improvement since a properly made normal map can look as good or better. Terrain parallax is way easier to manage and will not cause issues, you can safely add it on top of this guide.
		p #[strong A Matter of Time:] Has a broken plugin that contains HITME records. Resave in the Creation Kit for a fix, support will not be provided.
		p #[strong LOD billboards and pre-generated terrain LOD:] #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32382", target="_blank") DynDOLOD 3] generates object and tree LOD that will actually match your modlist with far better results than what resources can provide. #[a(href="https://stepmodifications.org/forum/topic/13451-xlodgen-terrain-lod-beta-95-for-fnv-fo3-fo4-fo4vr-tes5-sse-tes5vr-enderal-enderalse/", target="_blank") xLODGen] generates configurable terrain LOD.
		p #[strong SSE Fixes:] Mostly replaced by #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230", target="_blank") Engine Fixes], the only thing missing is the mutex fix, which you realistically only benefit from if you have a very large amount of plugins, way past what the guide has. If you do want to use this mod, then disable all of it's functions in the configuration file except for the mutex fix.
		p #[strong Summerset Isle:] Horribly made mod.
		p #[strong Anything made by Sinitar:] Sinitar knows nothing about modding, his modding "guides" are broken and full of bad information. If you have a few hours and want more information about Sinitar's lies, scamming, and lack of modding knowledge, check out #[a(href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F1-6lF8dI4i2Zz8iT-bv_Ci1VO9MSU4MiSUrT5JqgHA/edit", target="_blank") this] #[i twenty-eight] page essay that goes into excruciating detail about it.
		p #[strong Anything made by PredCaliber:] Same as above, another scam artist that knows nothing about modding.
		p #[strong Any mods that edit timescale:] Vanilla AI packages and scripts are based on the vanilla timescale, and can break and/or run when they aren't supposed to if the timescale is changed.
		p This list is far from comprehensive. There are still tons of mods not listed here that will break your game. This is why it is very important to have some modding knowledge before adding any mods. Always view every mod you install with #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164", target="_blank") SSEEdit] to check for conflicts.
