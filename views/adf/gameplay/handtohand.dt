	p Addon for Adamant - A Perk Overhaul that merges Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single skill and adds a new perk tree for Hand to Hand combat.
	blockquote The Locksmith Addon will make a change to the Remember Lockpick Angle mod so it now requires a perk before the game will remember lockpick position.
