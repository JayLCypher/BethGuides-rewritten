	blockquote The INI for this mod contains many configurable features, such as an adjustable level cap and carry capacity formula. You should look through the INI and see if there are any features you would like to change. For example, you can set #[strong fCarryWeightBase] to #[strong 150] if you want the vanilla carry weight formula back.
