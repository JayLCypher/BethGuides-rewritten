	blockquote This page contains mods that greatly overhaul the game by making it much more challenging (and more rewarding in turn) and adding new features. These mods are not recommended for a first playthrough of the game. It is especially important to thoroughly read the descriptions of these mods, so you know what has changed and how to use the new features. Every mod in this section should be considered to be #[strong.optional subjective] and as such they may not be suitable for everyone.
