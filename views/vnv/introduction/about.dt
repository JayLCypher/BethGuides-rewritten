		li #[b Stability:] The guide includes all essential stability enhancements and no placebo/dangerous mods.
		li #[b Performance:] Every tool, setting, and mod in the guide has been carefully selected and play-tested to ensure maximum possible performance. No 4k texture mods, no ENBs, no poorly scripted weather mods, or any other un-optimized/broken mods.
		li #[b Better Gameplay:] The guide includes many mods that greatly improve the gameplay, without drastically overhauling the core experience or straying away from the game's original intent. This section is highlighted by #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62153", target="_blank") Real Recoil] and #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66666", target="_blank") Just Assorted Mods]. There is also an optional #[b Overhauls] section that will make the game much more difficult and add some new vanilla-friendly content. This section is highlighted by #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61592", target="_blank") JSawyer Ultimate Edition] and #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64623", target="_blank") The Living Desert], so it is not recommended for first time players.
		li #[b Customizability:] The guide is partially modular, some mods are optional as indicated by their yellow name. Load order will be provided and it will work even if you left out any mods. For information regarding adding your own mods, see the #[a(href="#additional_mods") Additional Mods] section below.
