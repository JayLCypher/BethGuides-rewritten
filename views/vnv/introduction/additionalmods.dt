	p If you are looking to add more mods to your setup, please wait until #[b after] you have completed the guide, or else we will be unable to help you on Discord should you need it. Unfortunately, I do not have the time or energy to provide support for setups that install extra mods on top of the guide. If you do plan on adding mods after you finish the guide, please reference #[a(href="/avoid-mods", target="_blank") this] list of mods that you should avoid using. I can not stress enough that it is only recommended to add your own mods if you are an experienced modder and know how to manually make conflict resolution patches and sort your load order! You can't just throw a bunch of mods on top of the guide without doing any conflict resolution or use automated tools and expect your game to function as intended! A reminder that I will #[u not] support setups that have added any mods.
