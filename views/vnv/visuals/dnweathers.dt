	p Major overhaul to all of the weathers for the base game and DLCs.
	blockquote As visual mods are very subjective, not everyone will like DN Weathers. If you want an alternatives, I recommend checking out #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71404", target="_blank") Altitude], #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67277", target="_blank") Yellow Goodbye], or #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62481", target="_blank") Clarity]. Yellow Goodbye and Clarity aim for a much more vanilla style, mostly just removing the game's atmospheric tint. Meanwhile, Altitude aims to strike a balance between staying vanilla-friendly and being a complete overhaul. These three mods should have little to no performance loss, even on lower-end systems.
