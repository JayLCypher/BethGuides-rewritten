p #[strong FOOK, New Vegas Enhanced Content, and Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition:] Massive compilation mods like these eventually get outdated and break other mods like Yukichigai Unofficial Patch. For example, NVEC includes the old version of the Burning Campfires that causes save bloat, an old version of EVE that is even more performance-intensive than the current one, outdated bug fixes that break Yukichigai Unofficial Patch, and much more.
p #[strong Unlimited Companions (Or any other companion-related mods):] Unlimited Companions re-compiles every script in the game and will break many mods. If you want unlimited companions, or other companion-related features like equipment managing, infinite ammo, combat-ready companions, and much more, use #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50468", target="_blank") JIP Companions Command and Control]. Before installing any mods that edit companion behavior, you should check if JIP CCC already does it.
p #[strong Populated Casinos:] Poorly made mod with many dirty edits/ITMs/UDRs. The engine also can't handle that many NPCs in the same area without performance loss. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71037", target="_blank") Casino Crowds] instead.
p #[strong Freeside Open:] Suffers from the same engine limitations as Populated Casinos. Adds many new NPCs and pieces of unpolished restored content that cause many bugs and performance drops and lacks any sort of performance optimization. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73128", target="_blank") Simple Open Freeside] instead.
p #[strong Strip Open:] Same deal as Freeside Open, it pushes the engine to its limit with the large worldspace and added NPCs without any performance optimization. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73127", target="_blank") Simple Open Strip] instead.
p #[strong Increased Wasteland Spawns:] Causes save bloat due to using the #[b PlaceAtMe] function. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64638", target="_blank") Mojave Wildlife] (I recommend the #[b Vanilla No Chanced Spawns Version] version, though any version will work) and #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64623", target="_blank") The Living Desert] (already in the guide) instead.
p #[strong True Wasteland Economy:] Incredibly script-heavy, will cause save bloat and deteriorate performance over time. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62899", target="_blank") Economy Overhaul] or #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71604", target="_blank") New Vegas Improved Economy] instead.
p #[strong DUST:] Poorly made mod with almost 1000 errors in FNVEdit. Has a combination of deleted records, null references, missing records, and more.
p #[strong Any AI mods:] AI mods generally just edit gamesettings, which can both break set scenes (such as the vault in Dead Money and saving the Goodsprings settler in the tutorial mission) and make combat more frustrating than realistic. Enemies can sometimes detect you the second you enter an interior, so they will all rush you at the entrance.
p #[strong Weapon Mods Expanded/Extended:] Overwrites Weapon Mesh Improvement Mod's mesh fixes and requires conflict resoluton with any mods that edit weapon records. Also very unbalanced in my opinion, since many of the mods are either silencers or damage increases.
p #[strong More Perks:] Made in 2010 without the use of any script extenders, so many of the perks are broken or have poor implementation. Use #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76584", target="_blank") More Perks Reimagined] instead.
p #[strong CAGE - Continue After Games Ending:] Broken, use #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66726", target="_blank") Functional Post Game Ending] or #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73668", target="_blank") FPGE Lite] instead.
p #[strong NV Interiors Project:] Causes save bloat due to the large amount of havok-enabled items that all have their individual positions stored on the save when you enter an interior. Use #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71228", target="_blank") NV Interiors Remastered] instead.
p #[strong Classic Fallout Weapons:] Countless broken meshes and leveled lists, will cause crashes. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73805", target="_blank") Classic Fallout Weapons Remastered] instead.
p #[strong Honest Hearts Reborn:] Re-compiles every script in the game, so if you want to use it you must clean it in FNVEdit first. It will still have many bugs after cleaning though.
p #[strong Anything made by Sinitar:] Sinitar knows nothing about modding, his modding "guides" are broken and full of bad information. If you have a few hours and want more information about Sinitar's lies, scamming, and lack of modding knowledge, check out #[a(href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F1-6lF8dI4i2Zz8iT-bv_Ci1VO9MSU4MiSUrT5JqgHA/edit", target="_blank") this] #[i twenty-eight] page essay that goes into excruciating detail about it.
p #[strong Anything made by PredCaliber:] Same as above, another scam artist that knows nothing about modding.
p #[strong Any mods that edit timescale:] Vanilla AI packages and scripts are based on the vanilla timescale, and can break and/or run when they aren't supposed to if the timescale is changed.
p This list is far from comprehensive. There are still tons of mods not listed here that will break your game. This is why it is very important to have some modding knowledge before adding any mods. Always view every mod you install with #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34703", target="_blank") FNVEdit] to check for conflicts.
