p #[strong New Vegas Stutter Remover:] Will cause crashes roughly every 15 minutes. Every single feature from NVSR has been replaced in a modern manner by the combination of #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66537", target="_blank") New Vegas Tick Fix], #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69779", target="_blank") New Vegas Heap Replacer], and #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66347", target="_blank") lStewieAl's Tweaks]. These mods also have many great features that NVSR never had, like the high FPS physics fix. There is no reason to use NVSR, even on Windows 7.
p #[strong ENBoost:] New Vegas Tick Fix has much better memory management than ENBoost, and will increase performance/decrease stuttering more. ENBoost also needs a lot of system-specific configuration to work properly and can degrade performance without proper tweaking. ENB in general for New Vegas has been more or less abandoned in favor of Skyrim and Fallout 4.
p #[strong Zan AutoPurge Crash Protector/PCB Hotkey:] The script command used by these mods is a leftover command from development that forcefully clears buffered cells from memory, which can lead to unforeseen consequences. Essentially the same function is performed safely by the INI tweaks in the guide.
p #[strong Save Cleaner:] Works by going through your save file and deleting every REFR file, which will most likely break your save.
p #[strong Mission Mojave:] Heavily outdated compared to #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664", target="_blank") Yukichigai Unofficial Patch], will break more than it fixes and cause crashing.
p #[strong ENB:] As mentioned earlier with ENBoost, ENBs were never fully developed for New Vegas and have been abandoned by the author. They have a ton of bugs and performance issues, such as broken Anti-aliasing, transparent objects, and glowing objects (Though glowing objects can be mostly mitigated with #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73431", target="_blank") ENB Glowing Objects Overhaul]). They also use a lot of #[a(href="https://imgur.com/a/8UT356J", target="_blank") vision-obscuring effects] like depth of field, lens flares, bloom, and chromatic aberration to obscure the broken Anti-aliasing, which makes them very hard to play with. I recommend using a ReShade preset instead, such as #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76715", target="_blank") Vibrance] or #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71772", target="_blank") Vanilla Plus ReShade Preset].
p #[strong Oversized textures:] Based on the object size and how the texture is wrapped around it, you should pick textures with a reasonable resolution and avoid the very big ones also based on your display resolution. Keep in mind that the textures will not be displayed with their full resolution at all times, in fact they will be scaled down because of #[a(href="https://imgsli.com/MTMwNjU2", target="_blank") mipmaps] based on distance and other factors, as shown with these sliders. Just for reference, a maximum of 2K at 1080p is a pretty safe bet in terms of balance.
p #[strong Charge's HD Texture Pack/other AI-upscaled texture packs:] Mods upscaled with AI or other lazy techniques generally are not worth the resolution increase. Charge's in particular upscales files it shouldn't such as normal maps and glow maps, and has textures with #[a(href="https://imgur.com/a/9VhuCkm", target="_blank") major artifacting].
p #[strong Borderlands Inspired Numeric Damage:] Causes save bloat due to not destructing its strings. Also can be very performance intensive due to constantly-running scripts and has a bug that can cause NPCs to teleport directly to you upon entering an interior.
p #[strong Fallout Character Overhaul:] Multiple broken file paths which cause missing mesh triangles and pink textures. The installer auto-selects patches for mods you don't have installed and installs the Glowing Ghouls file which causes massive performance drops and save bloat. It doesn't cover every NPC in the game (Plus NPCs from the DLCs or mods), so any #[a(href="https://imgur.com/a/jMgRjBO", target="_blank") uncovered NPCs look very out of place]. It requires the #[b bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles] INI setting to be enabled, which causes performance loss due to generating NPC face textures on the fly in-game. It also overwrites many YUP fixes for NPCs, though these can be patched using FNVEdit. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71556", target="_blank") New Vegas Redesigned 2 Revised] or #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/64862", target="_blank") Character Expansions Revised] instead.
p #[strong Handheld Pip-Boys, such as the 2500:] All hand-held Pip-Boys share the #[a(href="https://imgur.com/a/3NBafn5", target="_blank") same common visual bugs] that occur if you enter/exit your Pip-Boy too fast. The methods these mods use to hide the Pip-Boy in third person are also quite janky, as they were made before NVSE extensions like JIP LN. These bugs and quirks have mostly been removed with #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/76009", target="_blank") Handheld Fixes] though. I still recommend either the #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/49732", target="_blank") 2500a] or #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65980", target="_blank") 2000 Mk VI] for wrist-mounted Pip-Boys.
p #[strong Electro City:] Has broken LOD that can cause crashing. Also includes #[a(href="https://imgur.com/a/spSSCZD", target="_blank") unnecessary bloat and leftover features from a planned quest]. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69226", target="_blank") A Little More Lamplight] instead (Already in the guide).
p #[strong Unnecessary Physics:] Causes save bloat since the game has to save the Havok state of every individual part of every object you move.
p #[strong Vault 22 Flora Overhaul:] Disables objects with the #[b Has Tree LOD] flag, which can cause crashing. Also has tons of unnecessary bloat such as new weapons, enemies, poison effects, skill books, and more. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71521", target="_blank") Vault 22 Flora Overhaul Remastered] instead. Be aware that the mod is still pretty performance-intensive and should be avoided on weaker systems
p #[strong New Vegas Landscape Overhaul Remastered:] Has broken navmeshes, deleted objects with the #[b Has Tree LOD] flag (Which can cause crashing), many floating/clipping objects, and bad balance. I recommend #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74218", target="_blank") New Vegas Landscape Overhaul Re-Remastered] instead. Be aware that the mod is still pretty performance-intensive and should be avoided on weaker systems.
p #[strong Project Reality:] Very poor scripting, will cause massive performance issues and save bloat. If you want a different weather mod than DN Weathers, I recommend either #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71404", target="_blank") Altitude], #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67277", target="_blank") Yellow Goodbye], or #[a(href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62481", target="_blank") Clarity] instead.
