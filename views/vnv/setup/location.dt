		li #[b Avoid any default Windows folders:] This includes but is not limited to #[code C:\Program Files], #[code C:\Program Files x86], your #[code Desktop], and your #[code Documents] folders. This is due to Windows UAC (or User Account Control), which heavily monitors and protects these folders. This can cause many issues with the game and any modding tools. As an example of a safe location, my Steam directory is #[code C:\Games\Steam].
